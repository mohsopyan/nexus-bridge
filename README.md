- **Engine Service**: Built with Python & FastAPI. Handles AI Integration and Data Analytics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (In Progress)
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Python
- **Frameworks**: Express.js, FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)
- **DevOps**: Docker, Git

## 🚦Getting Started
Currently in the development phase.
